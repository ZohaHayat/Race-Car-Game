# Race Car Game

## Project Description
This is a 2D race car game implemented using arrays, functions, and loops. The game features an interactive interface where players navigate a car while avoiding obstacles. Upon running the program, an opening screen appears displaying the game’s title, followed by instructions on how to play.  

Players can choose the difficulty level:
- **E** – Easy  
- **M** – Medium  
- **H** – Hard  

After selecting the difficulty and pressing Enter, the game starts. Players use the **left** and **right arrow keys** to control the car. The game ends when the car collides with an obstacle, and pressing Enter displays the final score.  

## Features
- 2D race car simulation  
- Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
